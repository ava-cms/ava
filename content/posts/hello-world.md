Welcome to your new Ava site!

This is a sample blog post to show you how content works. Each post is a Markdown file in `content/posts/` with YAML frontmatter at the top.

## Writing Content

Ava uses standard Markdown, so you can write **bold**, *italic*, and create [links](/) just like you'd expect.

### Code Examples

Syntax highlighting works automatically:

```php
// Query recent posts in your templates
$posts = $ava->query()
    ->type('post')
    ->published()
    ->perPage(5)
    ->get();
```

### Lists and Structure

- Posts live in `content/posts/`
- Pages live in `content/pages/`
- Custom content types are configured in `app/config/content_types.php`

## Built-in Shortcodes

Insert dynamic content anywhere:

- **Current year:** [year]
- **Site name:** [site_name]

## Next Steps

1. Edit this post or delete it
2. Create your own content in `content/posts/`
3. Customize your theme in `themes/default/`
4. Read the [documentation](https://ava.addy.zone) for more

Happy publishing!
