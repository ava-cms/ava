# Updates

Keeping Ava up to date is easy. We release updates regularly with new features and bug fixes.

!> **Always ensure you have a good backup before attempting to update.** Ava is in fairly early development and while we hope the updater will continue to seamlessly carry you through future versions, breaking changes may occur. See [Backup Strategies](#backup-strategies) below.

## How to Update

The easiest way is using the [CLI](cli.md):

```bash
# 1. Check for updates
./ava update:check

# 2. Apply the update
./ava update:apply
```

The updater will ask you to confirm that you have a backup before proceeding.

Ava will download the latest version from GitHub and update your core files.

## Backup Strategies

Because Ava is a flat-file CMS, backing up is incredibly simple. You don't need to dump databases or export complex configurations. You just need to copy files.

<div class="beginner-box">

## What Should I Back Up?

The most important folders to back up are:

- **`content/`** — All your pages, posts, and media
- **`app/config/`** — Your site settings
- **`themes/`** — Your customized themes

Everything else (like `core/`, `vendor/`, `storage/cache/`) can be regenerated or re-downloaded.

### The 3-2-1 Rule

For important data, consider the [**3-2-1 Backup Rule**](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/):

- **3 Copies:** Your live site plus at least two backups
- **2 Different Places:** Store them on different types of storage (e.g., cloud + local)
- **1 Off-Site:** Keep at least one copy somewhere other than your server

</div>

Here are some backup approaches, from simplest to most automated.

### 1. Download a Copy (Simple)

Just download your files and keep them safe somewhere.

**How:**
- Use SFTP to download your site folder
- Or use your host's file manager to create and download a ZIP
- Or via command line: `zip -r backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).zip .`

**Pros:** Quick, works anywhere, no setup required.
**Cons:** Manual effort, easy to forget, stored on same server until you download it.

### 2. Git Repository

If you're already using Git, your remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) is a natural backup.

**How:** Commit your changes and push to a remote repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before update"
git push origin main
```

**Pros:** Automatic history of every change, off-site storage, easy to roll back.
**Cons:** Requires Git knowledge, you need to remember to commit and push.

### 3. Cloud Sync (Set and Forget)

For production sites, consider automated sync to cloud storage.

**Options:**
- Use tools like `rclone` or `rsync` to sync folders
- Many hosts offer automated backups (check your control panel)
- Cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or S3 can sync automatically

**Example with rclone:**
```bash
rclone sync ./content remote:my-ava-backups/content
rclone sync ./app remote:my-ava-backups/app
```

**Pros:** Automatic, protects against server failure.
**Cons:** Requires initial setup, may have small storage costs.

### Which Should I Choose?

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Download a copy** | Occasional backups, before updates |
| **Git repository** | Developers, version tracking, collaboration |
| **Cloud sync** | Production sites, automated protection |

Many people combine approaches—Git for development history, plus periodic manual downloads before big changes.

## What Gets Updated?

The updater updates the core system files only. It's designed to leave your content and configuration alone.

**Updated:**
- `core/` — The Ava engine
- `bin/` — CLI tools
- `docs/` — Documentation
- `public/index.php` — Entry point
- `public/assets/admin.css` — Admin styles
- `bootstrap.php` — Bootstrap file
- `composer.json` — Dependencies

**Bundled plugins** (like `sitemap`, `feed`, `redirects`) are also updated, but new plugins aren't automatically activated.

**Not touched:**
- `content/` — Your pages, posts, and media
- `app/config/` — Your settings
- `themes/` — Your themes (including the default theme)
- `plugins/` — Your custom plugins (non-bundled)
- `storage/` — Cache, logs, temp files

!> **Important:** While the updater is designed to preserve your files, things can go wrong—especially during early development. Always have a backup before updating. If an update fails midway, you can restore from backup and try again, or do a [manual update](#manual-updates).

## Version Numbers

We use a simple date-based versioning system (like `25.12.1` for December 2025). This makes it easy to see how old your version is at a glance.

This scheme:
- Tells you roughly when a release was made
- Avoids semantic versioning debates
- Always increases (newer = higher)
- Allows unlimited releases per month

## Manual Updates

If you prefer not to use the built-in updater:

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Extract and copy the files listed in "What Gets Updated"
3. Run `php bin/ava rebuild` to rebuild the content index
4. Run `composer install` if `composer.json` changed

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not fetch release info from GitHub"

- Check your internet connection
- GitHub API may be rate-limited (60 requests/hour for unauthenticated)
- Try again in a few minutes

### Update fails mid-way

If an update fails partway through:

1. Restore from your backup (this is why backups are essential!)
2. Or try running the update again
3. Or do a [manual update](#manual-updates)

Your content and configuration are in separate directories from core files, so they're less likely to be affected—but with any file operations, there's always some risk.

### After updating, site shows errors

1. Run `composer install` to update dependencies
2. Run `php bin/ava rebuild` to rebuild the content index
3. Check the changelog for breaking changes
